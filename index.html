  <h2>Habitat Monitoring Methods</h2>
  <h3> Large Channel Habitat</h3>
  <p>Riverine habitat in the Upper Green River was stratified using methods described in Hawkins et al. 1993.
This 3-level habitat unit hierarchy offers the opportunity to measure significant variation in biotic and
environmental processes within a riverine system ( Table 3 ). Streams were initially segregated into fast
or slow moving waters. Fast water was then broken down further into turbulent and non-turbulent,
while slow water was broken into pools developed by water scour or natural damming. Turbulent, fast
water was divided into cascades (&gt;4% gradient) and riffles (&lt;4% gradient), while non-turbulent, fast
water was divided into runs (deep and swift with a well-defined thalweg) and glides (no defined
thalweg). Scour pools were divided into seven distinct types: eddy; trench; mid-channel; convergence;
lateral; plunge; and under scour, while dammed pools were represented by five types: debris; beaver;
landslide; backwater; and abandoned channel ( Table 4 ).</p>
  <h3> Side channel habitat</h3>
  <p>During the post-AWSP surveys, side channel habitat units were surveyed when greater than or equal to five feet in wetted width or when greater than or equal to 10 feet in exposed bed width, if dry. Side channels were further identified using a definition developed by Snohomish County Public Works, Surface Water Management:
  <br> Side channels are defined as channels that are separated from the main channel by a stable island and contain a smaller portion of the total flow. A stable island in a forested stream is defined as supporting woody vegetation (excluding willow) that is estimated to be at least five years old and covers at least 50% of the island surface at or above bankfull elevation (Rustay et al., 2008).
  <br> However, if an island is not inundated during bankfull flows, the island was consider stable even if the island has no vegetation at the time of survey.
  <br>Side channel segments were divided into three categories: dry, intermittent, and flowing. Individual habitat types are not delineated for side channels. The linear distance and average wetted width (for flowing channels only) of each side channel segment was recorded on a field computer (Apple iPad) running ESRI Collector and a representative photo was taken.
</p>
  <h3> Pools</h3>
  <p>Pools were identified in the field down to individual pool stratum.  The location and area of each pool was mapped as a polygons using an Eos Arrow 100 Global Navigation Satellite System Receiver (GNSS) linked via Bluetooth to an Apple iPad running ESRI Collector.  However, for the small tributaries (i.e. Cottonwood Creek, Piling Creek, and McDonald Creek) habitats were mapped as line features, areas were derived by multiplying linear distance, and average wetted width. Residual pool depth was monitored using methodology described by Lisle 1987 and Pleus et al. 1999. Maximum pool depth and riffle crest depth was measured using a stadia rod or Vexilar LPS-1 hand held sonar unit for deeper pools, to the nearest tenth of a foot.  The primary factors responsible for pool formation were also recorded: log; root wad; jam; tree roots; boulder; bedrock; bedform; rip-rap; beaver dam; or, other.  All pool monitoring data was recorded on the iPad. Habitat units in the mainstem Upper Green River had to have residual depths equal to or greater than 3 feet to be considered a measurable pool, while habitat units in Sunday Creek, Smay Creek and the North Fork Green River had to have residual depths equal to or greater than 1.5 feet. In other tributaries qualifying residual pool depth was equal to or greater than one foot. Similar methods were used for glides, cascades, riffles, and runs. However, these habitat units did not require maximum depth or residual depth monitoring. It is important to note that the baseline survey protocol used residual depths of 1.5 feet or greater to delineate pools in the mainstem Upper Green River. This difference in protocol resulted in more qualified pools in the baseline dataset than in the post-AWSP datasets. The post-AWSP surveys used the 3 foot residual depth requirement for the mainstem, because the majority of chinook spawning is expected to occur there would and represents the pool quality needed for the species (Marcotte, 1984). Therefore, pool parameter comparison will only include baseline data from pools equal to or greater than 3 feet in residual depth.
  </p>
  <h3> Individual large woody debris</h3>
  <p>To ensure consistency between the baseline and post-AWSP monitoring, LWD was surveyed using methods described in the August 2001 Green River Baseline Habitat Monitoring Report (R2 Resource Consultants 2002).  The LWD survey methods described in the 2001 monitoring report were based on a modified version of the Level 1 protocol (Figure 2) outlined in the TFW Method Manual for LWD Survey (Schuett-Hames et al. 1999).  Only wood located wholly or partially within Zone 1 (wetted channel) or Zone 2 (bankfull channel) were counted.  A piece was assigned to Zone 1 if a minimum of 4 inches (10 cm) of its length was within the water.  Similarly, a piece was assigned to Zone 2 if a minimum of 4 inches (10 cm) was within the bankfull channel, but did not extend the minimum length into the water.
  <br> To ease data collection efforts, individual pieces of LWD with a diameter smaller than 12 inches (30.5 cm) and a length of less than 30 feet (9 m) were counted only when they occurred as part of a qualifying LWD jam (i.e., 10 pieces or more). However, these smaller pieces must be at least 4 inches in diameter and 10 feet in length. Small individual pieces of wood that are not incorporated into a jam are unlikely to remain stable in the channel or influence channel morphology.
  <br> Under this protocol, ILWD and LWD jams were categorized by size as in Table 5. LWD jams categories are as follows: 10 to 50 pieces, small; 51 to 100 pieces, medium; and 101 pieces or more, large. Individual LWD (ILWD) categories as follows:  diameter 12 inches (30.5 cm) to 20 inches (50 cm), medium log; diameter greater than or equal to 20 inches (50 cm) but less than 33.5 inches (85 cm), large log; diameter greater than or equal to 33.5 inches (85 cm) and length greater than or equal to 30 feet (9 m), key piece.  Perkins’ (1999) minimum volume estimate for key pieces (6 m3) is considerably lower than the TFW minimum for 9 m3 for streams with bankfull width greater than 20 meters. However, Perkins used data collected for the Green River between Palmer and Auburn to develop the estimate and better reflects the minimum LWD size necessary for jam formation.  ILWD classifications also noted whether pieces had a root-ball or not.  To qualify as a root wad, the size of the root-mass must be a minimum of 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter. The location of all LWD jams and ILWD were recorded using an GNSS linked via Bluetooth to an Apple iPhone running Esri’s Survey 123 and Collector.
  </p>
  <h3> Engineered log jams</h3>
  <p>Stability and quality assessment of ELJs was based on alignment, location, extent of fragmentation or decay, and condition of anchoring material.  Structures were considered “stable” if: they rotated &lt; 20 degrees from original position; shifted &lt; 16 ft (LWD) or &lt; 2x diameter (boulders) from original position; anchor material remained intact; LWD had limited rot, decay or fragmentation. The recommended method for assessing ELJ structure stability and quality under CMM-10 was developed by Gaboury and Feduk (1996) and involves a qualitative rating of four key elements: structure performance; structural condition; structural stability; and, maintenance recommendations (Table 6). ELJ structural elements are composed of a collection of logs anchored into the channel or floodplain with lashings or chain attached to driven pilings or large boulders. In some cases these structures were also toed into adjacent stream banks, partially covered with excavated stream bed material, or placed unanchored. A large number of LWD pieces were loosely placed within the mainstem channel, side channels, and floodplain as well. Each ELJ structure in the project received a rating score based on this method. Loosely placed LWD was expected to deform and move and were not rated. Combined scores of 4-8 were considered poor; 9-12 fair; and, 13-16 good.
  <br>
  In the post-ASWP surveys, LWD jam typology (Abbe and Montgomery 2003) information was gathered for each jam identified during the survey (Table 7).  The identification of these jam types is based on mode of LWD recruitment to the site and the orientation of key, racked, and loose LWD pieces relative to the channel axis.  Though some LWD jam types have few channel forming effects, others develop into stable in-stream structures that can influence channel form, cross-section, and complexity.
  </p>
  <h3> Cross-section Monitoring</h3>
  <p>Cross-sectional surveys were conducted at appropriate locations near the beginning of each survey reach and approximately every 1,000 feet thereafter to survey end.  Each survey site was located using a GNSS reciever and included measurement of the bankfull and wetted channel width as well as the percentage of canopy closure (Schuett-Hames et al. 1999).  For the 2017/2018 survey, the bankfull and wetted channel width were measured using the Arrow 100 GNSS receiver, while canopy cover was captured with a convex spherical densiometer (Lemmon 1956). All cross-section data was recorded in a field computer (Apple iPad or iPhone) running ESRI Collector. The baseline survey and post-AWSP surveys utilized HHD inflow average daily discharge as a surrogate for all reaches to compare current base flow condition at the time of the post-AWSP survey versus baseline conditions.
  </p>

  <h3> Bankfull survey points</h3>
  <p>description</p>
  <h3> Pebble counts (Surface substrate monitoring)</h3>
  <p>During the 2017/2018 post-AWSP survey channel surface substrate size distribution (Harrelson et al 1994) was measured at the same locations as cross-section monitoring. This is a departure from the method used for the 2012/2013 survey where measurement were made at sites as close as possible to locations measured during the baseline surveys to detect change over time. However, sites measured in 2017/2018 were frequent enough that comparable sites close to the 2012/2013 locations were measured. Substrate particle measurement counts were collected on data forms in the field and transferred to the Pebble Count Analyzer (Excel-based) in the office where the surface substrate size distribution (i.e. D16, D50, and D84) was determined and graphed. The size distribution charts for all reaches surveyed are provided in Appendix B.

<h2>LiDAR Derived Data</h2>
<h3> From QSI </h3>
<p>High-resolution LiDAR data and digital imagery collected in for the Upper Green River Watershed (QSI, 2019) was utilized to map  and measure water area, thalweg length, stream network length. Water area and thalweg/stream network length was determined by utilizing GIS shapefile products provided by the contractor.
Acquisition dates for these products were December and November of 2017 and 2018, respectively. Thus, water area is not comparable to in-situ surveys without hydrologic modeling. Thalweg and stream network length, however, are comparable and will be compared to in-situ thalweg and stream network lengths.
</p>
<h3>Stream Slope</h3>
<p>Water slope was calculate by [briefly describe our methodology]. Water surface slope will be used to present the suitability of an instream feature for fish use potential (WDFW, 2019). </p>
